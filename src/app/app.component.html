      <span>We are a community based help service!</span>
      <br>
      <span>Our product solves the problem with the lack of fast, context-specific and most importantly - untampered help out there.</span>
      <span>We solve that problem for our users by providing them an instant and specific help from people that may have already walked the same path and bought the same product.</span>
      <span>So next time, when you visit a site and you can't find a review or an answer that satisfies your information needs, you can open up our chat widget and ask a non-formal question to one of our helpers.</span>

        So you finally decided to buy that new phone and found it in website, at a great price. However, you are still not sure and want to find out if its performance will be the same, two years ahead in time? If you ask the customer support of that website, they will surely somehow convince you that what you wanna buy is the perfect product. Imagine if you can ask somebody that has already purchased this exact same product, without leaving the site?
